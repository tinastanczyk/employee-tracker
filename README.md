  ## Description
  This project was motivated by the intent to learn how to utilize mySQL2 package in a command-line node application. The project is able to add employees, roles and departments and save it to a local database. It also allows the user to view all departments, role, employees and update employee info(i.e. role and manager). I learned how to use mySQL2 and the console.table package. I also learned how to create databases and tables within databases using mysql.
